# Critique Rules

## Core Principles

1. **Be Specific, Not General**
   - ❌ "Your email is too long"
   - ✅ "The third paragraph repeats points from the introduction"

2. **Identify Hidden Assumptions**
   - Look for implied context the receiver might not have
   - Flag jargon or internal references
   - Question unstated expectations

3. **Surface Emotional Subtext**
   - Identify potential emotional triggers
   - Flag language that might be perceived differently than intended
   - Consider cultural/professional context

4. **Prioritize Actionable Feedback**
   - Every critique should suggest a specific improvement
   - Focus on what can be changed, not style preferences
   - Provide examples when possible
