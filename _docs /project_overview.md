## Project Overview for Email Radar

Email Radar is a Grammarly/QuillBot-style text analysis tool that helps users improve their email communication through AI-powered analysis. Users paste or type their email text into a beautiful web interface and receive three levels of intelligent feedback.

## Core Value Proposition

A simple, aesthetic text analysis platform where users can:
1. **Grammar & Punctuation Fixes** - Automatic corrections like Grammarly
2. **Tone Analysis** - Visual feedback on how their email sounds/feels with color coding
3. **Mirrored Response** - AI-generated response showing how their email might be received

## Target User Experience

Users visit our website and see a clean, beautiful landing page with:
- Simple text editor (similar to Grammarly or QuillBot interface)
- Instant analysis as they type or paste content
- Three distinct panels showing grammar fixes, tone analysis, and response preview
