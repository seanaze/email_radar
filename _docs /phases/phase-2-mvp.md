# Phase 2: MVP â€“ Text Analysis Assistant

This document defines the scope and deliverables for the MVP phase of Email Radar. The goal is to deliver a presentable, functional text-analysis assistant that demonstrates clear value: grammar correction, tone analysis, and an AI-generated mirrored reply, similar in polish to Quillbot or Grammarly.

## Scope
- Build a complete text-entry and analysis experience
- Implement custom grammar checking (nspell-based or AI fallback)
- Add tone & emotion analysis with color legend
- Generate mirrored response drafts with LLM
- Create a presentable UI that feels professional and polished

## Deliverables

- [ ] Word/character counter & placeholder text

### 3. Three-Step Analysis Pipeline

- [ ] Mirrored response draft using OpenAI/Claude LLM (Step 3)
- [ ] Single API route `POST /api/analyzeText` orchestrates the steps

### 4. Results Display
- [ ] Side-by-side diff or in-place correction with undo
- [ ] Color-coded tone badge with description tooltip
- [ ] Mirrored reply panel with copy button
